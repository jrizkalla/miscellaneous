## Episoder
Episoder is a program that keeps track of episodes you watch in a series (pre Netflix era).
I made it in the summer before my 12th grade in high school as a way to learn Java so I wasn't entirely sure what I was doing :)

The GUI is created using `java.awt` and it's completely static (does not allow resizing at all). I only tested it on a Windows Vista machine so it might not look the same on all devices.

A few notes about the program:
- The interface does not actually spend any time loading, I just thought a loading screen looked cool
- The program saves information in a text file called `ASD150.txt`. This name does not represent anything, I just thought that a weird name will prevent the user from opening and modifying the file
